# Sky Sail Cars

**Demo Project for a fictional car rental startup**

## Info

This project is a demo project for a fictional car rental startup. It is based on the [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)
framework. As a CSS framework it uses [POSTCSS](https://postcss.com/) ÔºÜ [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for
styling.
It is fully responsive and uses the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.
The entire project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
Nitro handles the API calls and the data fetching to avoid cors issues on the client.
The API is not CORS enabled and therefore the client cannot access the API directly.

### ‚úÖ Client to Server with API

## Testing

### Component Testing VITEST

1. Missing implementation
2. Write test suits for the given test

## Enhanced Feature Suggestions
1. **Optimized User Interface:**
    - **Infinite Scroll with Virtual List:**  
      Mitigate excessive DOM overload by combining Infinite Scroll with a Virtual List, ensuring optimal performance and
      responsiveness.
2. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Session Storage:**  
     Store the fetched data in the session storage to reduce the number of API calls.
3. **Static Site Generation**
   - **Pre-rendering:**  
     Pre-render the entire site to improve SEO and performance.

## Thoughts

The app follows the FLEX pattern to operate from a single source of truth. It is recommended to split it up in a
domain-driven manner. An option store should be defined for the search, utilizing the built-in API exposed by Pinia.

```typescript
const store = useOptionStore()
store.$reset();
store.$forceUpdate()
```

The automated API typing could be further refined through PRISMA or OPENAPI.

Final some UI details could be improved.
