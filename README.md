# Sky Sail Cars

**Demo Project for a fictional car rental startup**

## Info

This project is a demo project for a fictional car rental startup. It is based on the [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)
framework. As a CSS framework it uses [POSTCSS](https://postcss.com/) ÔºÜ [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for
styling.
It is fully responsive and uses the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.
The entire project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).


## Observations

üí• CORS issue related to api endpoint

```json
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "localhost"
```

## Testing

### Component Testing VITEST

1. Missing implementation
2. Write test suits for the given test

## Enhanced Feature Suggestions

1. **Persistent API Store Data:**  
   Enable seamless searching by storing API data in sessions, ensuring a consistent and efficient user experience.

2. **Local Search Optimization:**  
   Leverage Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities to enhance local search functionality, building on the current short-term solution of saving data to local storage.

3. **Efficient Data Navigation:**
   - **Infinite Scroll:**  
     Implement a dynamic loading mechanism for smoother browsing without the need for manual page changes.
   - **Pagination with Query Parameters:**  
     Introduce a structured pagination system using query parameters, allowing users to navigate through data sets with ease.

4. **Optimized User Interface:**
   - **Infinite Scroll with Virtual List:**  
     Mitigate excessive DOM overload by combining Infinite Scroll with a Virtual List, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness.


## Thoughts

The app follows the FLEX pattern to operate from a single source of truth. It is recommended to split it up in a domain-driven manner. An option store should be defined for the search, utilizing the built-in API exposed by Pinia.

```typescript
const store = useOptionStore()
store.$reset();
store.$forceUpdate()
```

The automated API typing could be further refined through PRISMA or OPENAPI.

Final some  ui details are missing, but the core functionality is there.
