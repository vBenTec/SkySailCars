## Observations

üí• CORS issue related to api endpoint

```json
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "localhost"
```

## Testing

### Component Testing VITEST

1. Missing implementation
2. Write test suits for the given test

## Feature Suggestion

1. Searching through api store data in session
2. Searching local (is implemented already through saving data to local storage short-term solution ‚úÖ) could be
   implemented with PWA
3. Infinite Scroll OR Pagination (Pagination through query params)
4. If Infinite Scroll Virtual list to prevent exessive Dom overload

## Thoughts

App follows the FLEX mythology to work from one single source of truth. It should be split up domain driving. There
should be a option store defined for the search, since we can use the build in api exposed by pinia

```ts
const store = useOptionStore()
store.$reset();
store.$forceUpdate()
```

The setup store should be used for coupled stores. Since we can access each store instance inside the given scope.
